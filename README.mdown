It’s very much alpha. Maybe even pre-alpha. But if you want to try it out here are the instructions:

* Launch Boxee.
* Go to “apps”.
* Down the left, right at the bottom under “extras”, is “repositories”.
* In there is an option to “add repository”.
* Hit that and enter “boxee.donotremove.co.uk”.
* That should get you “Mike’s Boxee repo” and in there is “4OD”.
* Hit that and go “add to my apps”.
* Start it.

For more information about this app see [the article on my blog](http://donotremove.co.uk/weblog/4od-on-boxee).
